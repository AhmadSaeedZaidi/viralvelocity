"""Idempotent setup of the Pleiades Prefect orchestration on the micro control plane.

This captures the orchestration config that lives ONLY in the micro's SQLite
DB — the work-pool global concurrency limit, and the per-deployment work-queue
limits + priorities — so the 2-VPS setup is reproducible after a micro rebuild
or work-pool recreation.

What it does:
  * sets the ``default`` work pool global ``concurrency_limit`` to 9 (one slot
    per queue; the worker's ``CPUQuota=180%`` cgroup + per-queue ``limit=1``
    prevent CPU saturation on the 2-core box)
  * creates/updates one work queue per deployment, each ``concurrency_limit=1``
    so every agent type runs at most one instance at a time

It does NOT touch deployment schedules or ``work_queue_name`` bindings — those
live in ``prefect.yaml`` and are applied by ``prefect deploy``.

SECURITY: contains no secrets. All credentials (``PREFECT_API_URL``, and if the
server requires auth, ``PREFECT_API_KEY``) are read from the environment — the
same env the ``prefect-worker`` systemd unit already exports. Never paste tokens
into this file.

Usage (run on the executor VPS, with the worker's env available):
    export PREFECT_API_URL=http://10.0.0.22:4200/api
    python tools/setup_orchestration.py

# Global ceiling for the 2-core executor. Set to the number of queues (9) so
# every agent type gets exactly one slot.  With per-queue `limit=1` the worst
# case is 9 concurrent runs, safe under the worker's CPUQuota=180% cgroup
# backstop (most agents are cheap DB queries; the heavy ffmpeg agents are
# limited to 1 each anyway).
#
# HISTORY: was 5 with strict priorities 1-9, which caused priority starvation:
# heartbeat(1)/janitor(2)/archeologist(3)/tracker(4)/hunter(5) filled the pool
# and streamer(9)/singer(8)/painter(7) never got a slot → no raw videos fetched
# → pipeline stalled.  With limit=9 every queue gets a slot regardless, matching
# the old "all agents run concurrently" model.

# Per-deployment work queues — same order as docs/micro-prefect-orchestration.md §3.
# Priority is moot when GLOBAL_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT ≥ len(QUEUES) because every
# queue with pending work gets a slot.  Priorities are kept for a visual ordering
# in the Prefect UI; they do not gate scheduling.

        # dropped in the churn) end up with `work_queue_id=None` — the worker polls
        # the fresh queues but the server never hands it the stranded runs, so every
        # agent freezes indefinitely. That is far worse than the transient +1h
        # `expected_start_time` wedge the delete was meant to cure. The correct cure
        # for a genuine scheduler wedge is to reap the stale non-terminal runs (see
