"""Shared vault batch-store + per-video DB-marker plumbing.

The artifact fetchers (streamer / singer / muralist) all do the identical thing
once they have extracted bytes for a batch of videos:

* write every artifact to the vault in **ONE** commit (to stay under HuggingFace's
  128-commits/hour account cap), then
* mark each video safe, or — on a vault/network failure — roll every video back
  (release to PENDING or mark FAILED) so a transient blip never strands good work.

:func:`commit_artifacts` centralises that pattern so each agent's
``store_results`` is a one-liner instead of a copy-pasted try/except/loop.
(Painter uses a bespoke vault API — ``store_visual_evidence_batch`` — and keeps
its own ``store_results``.)
